 The Decoration and Furnishing of the City - No. 2
 Pliny, writing about a.d. 50, tells us that statues were placed on
 <a href="https://www.decorativeceilingtiles.net/roman-corinthian-fad-faux-marble-finish-column-cpf-008-rc/  " style="color: blue;">columns</a> to raise them above others of ordinary men, and that the custom
 of erecting <a href="https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005001698087232.html" style="color: blue;">columns</a> for this purpose is a much older one than that of
 erecting arches. The Greeks were probably the first to place statues on

Plate 46 shows a restoration of four such <a href="your-link-here" style="color: blue;">columns</a> from
 Delphi and Olympia. These are not immense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgHy9QbVbh4  " style="color: blue;">columns</a> borrowed from
 the peristyles of temples, but original conceptions, subsidiary to the
 buildings and having an entity entirely their own.
 It was reserved for the Romans, whose sense of fitness was less
 acute, to copy the pillars of their temples, magnify them, and use them
 in this way.
 Perhaps the most notable of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/exYhf8kgKJI " style="color: blue;">columns</a> erected by the Romans is
 that of Trajan, which originally supported a statue of that Emperor. A
 particularly beautiful feature of this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/books/review/the-fourth-turning-is-here-neil-howe-end-times-peter-turchin.html " style="color: blue;">column</a> is the festoon of bay leaves
 which is wreathed around its pedestal, and upon which rest four
 eagles at the corners. A colossal cast of the pedestal and a portion of the
 shaft of this <a href="https://eliseprudhomme.com/wild-wild-west/colosseum-dreams-columns-for-sale-las-vegas-nevada-usa/ " style="color: blue;">column</a> is to be seen in the South Kensington Museum. It
 is the prototype of many others since erected during both ancient and
 modern times ; that of Marcus Aurelius, which is still standing, was more
 or less a copy of this one; it, however, does not possess that perfection
 of proportion which may be claimed for that of Trajan. Apart from
 these colossal <a href="https://rentneon.com/item/K90x4dDQgLwDzps4sZHm " style="color: blue;">columns</a>, the Romans adorned their public places with
 <a href="https://www.do-shop.com/products/las-vegas-side-table-lamp?variant=42305593311383 " style="color: blue;">columns</a> of a smaller type, as the Rostral <a href="your-link-here" style="color: blue;">Column</a>. Such a one was
 erected 260 B.C. to the memory of Duillius, a naval hero who defeated the
 Carthaginians. Cannina's restoration of this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40100502?seq=1 " style="color: blue;">column</a> is shown on plate
 52. In form it was a Doric shaft enriched with the prows of ships.
 Innumerable <a href="https://pillarsofrome.weebly.com/how-were-columns-created.html#:~:text=The%20main%20style%20orders%20were,%22%20order%2C%20which%20was%20flowery. " style="color: blue;">columns</a> erected since have been based on this example,
 and it has come to be the traditional form of monument to commemorate
 a naval success. But in using it, it must be remembered that it has its
 limitations of scale, that it is essentially a subsidiary feature, and that it
 cannot serve the same purpose as and must not be used in place of great
 commemorative monuments like the Vendome <a href="your-link-here" style="color: blue;">Column</a> in Paris, and the
 Trajan <a href="your-link-here" style="color: blue;">Column</a> in Rome.
 It is very suitably placed in duplicate in front of the Exchange at St.
 Petersburg, but single <a href="your-link-here" style="color: blue;">columns</a> of this type have been erected in important
 positions in Vienna and New York in questionable taste. The latter
 is badly proportioned, much too slender, and very unsatisfactory in every
 way ; it supports a statue of Columbus, and is situated in Columbus
 Square. The former supports the statue of Admiral Tegetthof, and is
 the better example of the two (see plate 52). The connection between
 the bronze work and the marble in both these examples is unsatisfactory.
 Bronze work used in this way to ornament white marble should be gilt,
 otherwise the contrast will be too hard, especially in smoky towns where
 bronze does not assimilate green hues. Remains that have been found
 of ancient bronze work used in this way appear to have been heavily gilt.
 Columns were erected by the Romans throughout the Empire, and may
 still be seen standing at Cussy in Burgundy, at Brindisi, at Alexandria,
 and at Antinoe. The latter example is of the Corinthian order, and its
 shaft springs from an acanthus base.
 During the Mediaeval period it was only those countries like Italy, which
 were immediately influenced by the the proximity of Ancient Rome, that
 knew anything of the erection of columns, or which indulged in this way
 in honouring distinguished men. During the Renaissance it was
 the custom of the Italians to erect monuments out of the remains of the
 Imperial ruins, and according to Piranesi, Pope Paul V. erected a column
 in Rome which was taken from a Roman temple. This column (see plate
 52) is of particular interest because it supports a cornice and a frieze.
 Compared with our own Nelson Column, which is of the same order, it is
 much finer in outline ; in the case of the latter, the figure is too abruptly
 placed upon the cap.
 Of columns erected out of Italy during later Renaissance and modern
 times, few perhaps are better known than that which was designed by
 Wren about 1671 in commemoration of the great fire of London in 1666.
 As a Doric shaft commemorating an event it is perhaps unsurpassed.
 See plate 50.
 Of other important Doric columns (erected in comparatively modern
 times), mention should be made of the Vendome, Paris, designed by
 Gondouin, a pupil of Blondel, and erected in 1810 to commemorate the
 victories of Napoleon. It supports his statue, and the whole is cast out
 of the metal of 1,200 guns captured in his wars. There is also the Napo-
 leon column at Boulogne originally designed to commemorate the despatch
 of his armies for British shores. It was intended that the statue should
 face out to sea, but eventually it faced in-shore. Many similar columns
 based with more or less correctness on the Trajan, exist in this country
 and in the colonies, most of which support statues of either Nelson or the
 Duke of Wellington.  Amongst the more important may be mentioned
 the Duke of Wellington Column at the head of the Duke of York Stairs,
 London ; the Wellington Column, Liverpool ; columns at Dublin and
 Yarmouth designed by Wilkins, a column at Newcastle designed by
 Green, one at Hull supporting a statue of Wilberforce, and one at Shrewbbury supporting a statue of Lord Hill. They are i
 tecture of the period, that at Liverpool and t
 London, being Roman Doric, the others being
 The pedantic correctness of these columns robbe
 interest and originality seen in the early example
 was not until the Neo-Greek revival had set in
 received its full decorative value.
 But previously to the Neo-Greek revival several columns were erected
 in Paris which, considering the period of their erection, were extremely
 original. Of such may be mentioned the twin columns which surmount
 pavilions erected on the site of the old Barriere du Throne, and which were
 designed by Ledoux in 1788, also the Chatelet Column erected in 1807 in
 the Place du Chatelet, and, later, the well-known column of July, 1830,
 erected on the site of the Bastille, and which clearly shows the early
 influence of the Neo-Greek movement in Prance.
 During this Neo-Greek period quite a new conception of the possi-
 bilities of the monumental column arose, resulting in greater freedom
 of treatment. Now for the first time since the Greek period it
 becomes a decorated shaft. It is fluted, banded, rusticated, and
 festooned ; palm leaves and bay leaves are carved entwined around its
 smooth hard surface and suspended are shields, trophies, and insignia
 of all kinds. Such was that designed by Nenot, which was awarded first
 prize in the competition for the King Humbert Memorial at Rome.
 Examples of others which received prizes in the competition for a column
 inaugurated in Paris in 1881 to celebrate the Constitutional Assembly at
 Versailles are shown on plate 53. Besides the Martyr's Monument,
 New York, which is a very beautiful column, we have in America four
 others erected at the Plaza entrance to Prospect Park; they are
 enriched to one-third of their height with small shafts supporting eagles
 and an eagle on a ball surmounts the whole. These columns are from
 the designs of McKim, and in their strength and refinement bear evidence
 of his master hand.
 In conclusion, the column used as the pedestal of a statue should be
 reserved for rare occasions, and to honour men whose distinction is
 exceptional.
 In the early part of this century, when most of our modern columns
 were erected, they were set up almost exclusively to support the statues
 of naval and military heroes, in particular Nelson and Napoleon. This
 in itself has tended to justify us in the present day in associating statues
 on columns with naval and military men rather than with philanthropists
 or kings ; and although the exclusive use of the column to support the
 naval and military hero has no foundation in ancient tradition, at the
 same time its persistent use in this way early in la
 carry with it associations from which we cannot ea
 In order to give some idea of the scale of the lar
 of existing columns, it may be mentioned that
 abacus, and not including the figure and its pedestal
 measures 115 feet; the Monument, London, 174
 Paris, 116 feet; the Napoleon, Boulogne, 141 feet
 Column, London, 95 feet.
